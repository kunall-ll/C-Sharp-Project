# C Sharp-Project

Console Sales app project using C# and mySQL for QA Academy. 

## Why are we doing this project?
To create a sales console application applying learning of C# and SQL.

## How I expected the challenge to go
Slowly and with pitfalls and unexpected challenges as I knew there would be a lot of hidden details. I knew I'd have to revisit some concepts.

## What went well?
The console interface and the SQL logic.

## What did not go as planned?
No controllers or services. I attempted to create this from scratch.

## Possible improvements for the future
Include controllers and services and proper exception handling.

## Features
The user can select to Create a sale in the database or Read from the database. 

Reports are available for:
* Sales by Year (e.g. List of all sales in the year 2020 printed to the console)
*	Sales by Month and Year (e.g. List of all sales in January of 2020 printed to the console)
*	Total Sales by Year (e.g. The total amount of sales for 2021, i.e. the sum of all the sales)
*	Total Sales by Year and Month (e.g. The total amount of sales for January of 2021)
*	All sales between two specified years (inclusive)
*	All sales between two specified years and months (inclusive)
